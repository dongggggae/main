      <h1>Moby Dick</h1>

        Dropping his spade, he thrust both hands in, and drew out handfuls of
        something that looked like ripe Windsor soap, or rich mottled old
        cheese; very unctuous and savory withal. You might easily dent it with
        your thumb; it is of a hue between yellow and ash colour. And this, good
        friends, is ambergris, worth a gold guinea an ounce to any druggist.
        Some six handfuls were obtained; but more was unavoidably lost in the
        sea, and still more, perhaps, might have been secured were it not for
        impatient Ahab's loud command to Stubb to desist, and come on board,
        else the ship would bid them good bye.

        Now this ambergris is a very curious substance, and so important as an
        article of commerce, that in 1791 a certain Nantucket-born Captain
        Coffin was examined at the bar of the English House of Commons on that
        subject. For at that time, and indeed until a comparatively late day,
        the precise origin of ambergris remained, like amber itself, a problem
        to the learned. Though the word ambergris is but the French compound for
        grey amber, yet the two substances are quite distinct. For amber, though
        at times found on the sea-coast, is also dug up in some far inland
        soils, whereas ambergris is never found except upon the sea. Besides,
        amber is a hard, transparent, brittle, odorless substance, used for
        mouth-pieces to pipes, for beads and ornaments; but ambergris is soft,
        waxy, and so highly fragrant and spicy, that it is largely used in
        perfumery, in pastiles, precious candles, hair-powders, and pomatum. The
        Turks use it in cooking, and also carry it to Mecca, for the same
        purpose that frankincense is carried to St. Peter's in Rome. Some wine
        merchants drop a few grains into claret, to flavor it.

        Who would think, then, that such fine ladies and gentlemen should regale
        themselves with an essence found in the inglorious bowels of a sick
        whale! Yet so it is. By some, ambergris is supposed to be the cause, and
        by others the effect, of the dyspepsia in the whale. How to cure such a
        dyspepsia it were hard to say, unless by administering three or four
        boat loads of Brandreth's pills, and then running out of harm's way, as
        laborers do in blasting rocks.
